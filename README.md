# XORLib - old school game library

XORLib is a simple multiplatform game library that is licensed under
MIT-license and developed at least for two platforms:

- PIC32 with NTSC and PAL TV
- DOS with CGA/EGA/VGA

PIC32 code based on "NTSC TV interface" examples from
http://hackaday.io/project/2032-pic32-oscilloscope
by Bruce Land (Cornell University) that is based on some ideas from
"Programming 32-bit Microcontrollers in C: Exploring the PIC32"
by Lucio Di Jasio.

DOS code doesn't exist yet...

GIF decoder was taken from NetSurf project (MIT-license):

http://www.netsurf-browser.org/projects/libnsgif/

JPG decoder is a public domain library called "picojpeg":

https://code.google.com/p/picojpeg/

Folder "examples" has some public domain apps for XORLib.

In order to build PIC32 application you need MPLAB X IDE from Microchip
with XC32 compiler. You need to create empty project for PIC32MX170256B
(or smaller device if your program will fit) and add header files:
- xorlib.h
- nedofont.h

and source files:
- xorlib.c
- nedofont.c
- yourapp.c (with function main - for example hello.c).

Then you need to add additional options for xc32-gcc (in Project Properties):
- option -DPIC32NTSCQ (if you have external crystal 14.31818 MHz) will set
28.63636MHz as peripheral clock and 57.27272MHz as CPU clock.
- option -DPIC32NTSC (if you don't have external crystal 14.31818 MHz and
internal 8 MHz oscillator will be used instead) will set 32MHz as peripheral
clock and 64MHz as CPU clock (it's faster, but color modes will not
be available with this option).

Also it is a good idea to power your device through the same PICkit3 that
you will use for programming (option "Power" for PICkit3 configuration of
Project Properties in MPLAB X).
