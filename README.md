# XORLib - old school game library for anyone

Library created by Alexander A. Shabarshin and most
parts of the source code are covered by MIT-license.
Targeted platforms: PIC32 with NTSC and DOS with CGA/EGA/VGA.

PIC32 code based on "NTSC TV interface" examples from
http://hackaday.io/project/2032-pic32-oscilloscope
by Bruce Land (Cornell University) that is based on some ideas from
"Programming 32-bit Microcontrollers in C: Exploring the PIC32"
by Lucio Di Jasio.
