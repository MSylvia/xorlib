# XORLib - old school game library

XORLib is a simple multiplatform game library that is licensed under
MIT-license and developed at least for two platforms:

- PIC32 with NTSC TV and may be PAL TV and VGA
- DOS32 with CGA and partially EGA/VGA

Version 0.x means that library is in active developement right now and
far from completion, but usable. Check progress on our
[wiki](https://github.com/shaos/xorlib/wiki).

Folder "tools" has some tools licensed under MIT-license.

Folder "tests" has some test programs licensed under MIT-license.

Folder "examples" has some public domain apps for XORLib - you can use
them as a base for your application!

PIC32 code based on "NTSC TV interface" examples from

"Programming 32-bit Microcontrollers in C: Exploring the PIC32"
by Lucio Di Jasio.

GIF decoder was taken from NetSurf project "libnsgif" (MIT-license):

JPG decoder is a public domain library called "picojpeg":

## Usage

In order to build PIC32 application you need MPLAB X IDE from Microchip
with XC32 compiler. You need to create empty project for PIC32MX170256B
(or smaller device if your program will fit) and add header files:
- xorlib.h
- nedofont.h

and source files:
- xorlib.c
- nedofont.c
- yourapp.c (with function main - for example hello.c).

Then you need to add additional options for xc32-gcc (in Project Properties):
- option -DPIC32NTSCQ (if you have external crystal 14.31818 MHz) will set
28.63636MHz as peripheral clock and 57.27272MHz as CPU clock (this option
enables NTSC colors).
- option -DPIC32NTSC (if you don't have external crystal 14.31818 MHz and
internal 8 MHz oscillator will be used instead) will set 30MHz as peripheral
clock and 60MHz as CPU clock (black and white modes only).

Also it is a good idea to power your device through the same PICkit3 that
you will use for programming (option "Power" for PICkit3 configuration of
Project Properties in MPLAB X).
