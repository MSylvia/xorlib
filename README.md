# XORLib - old school game library

XORLib is a simple multiplatform game library that is licensed under
MIT-license and developed at least for two platforms:

- PIC32 with NTSC and PAL TV
- DOS with CGA/EGA/VGA

PIC32 code based on "NTSC TV interface" examples from
http://hackaday.io/project/2032-pic32-oscilloscope
by Bruce Land (Cornell University) that is based on some ideas from
"Programming 32-bit Microcontrollers in C: Exploring the PIC32"
by Lucio Di Jasio.

DOS code doesn't exist yet...
